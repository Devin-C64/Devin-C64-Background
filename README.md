- 👋 Hi, I’m @Devin-C64
- 👀 I’m interested in data structures and how to effectively sort data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program in assembly and machine language and how to use graphs with nodes and edges to contain data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects orbiting around the archival of data or software engineering
